Cosmic Clash is a simple 2D OpenGL-based space shooter game developed in Python. In this project, players control a rectangular "ship" defending against alien attacks represented by colorful circles. The objective is to eliminate aliens by shooting bullets, while evading or deflecting incoming alien bullets to protect the ship's three lives. Each alien hit adds points to the score, while each ship hit by an alien bullet reduces the life count. Cosmic Clash features randomly fired alien bullets and a score display, providing an engaging and interactive gameplay experience.

Key Features:

    Player movement and bullet firing using keyboard input
    Randomized alien attacks for dynamic gameplay
    Score tracking and lives display
